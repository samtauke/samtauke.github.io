## New York Academy of Sciences Data Challenge

My entry into the 2020 NYAS data science challenge, which was chosen as one of five finalists for the competition.  This multivariate linear model, implemented in R, predicts crop assessment scores as a function of a number of a number of input factors.

An analysis of the speed of BTC transactions from 2012 to 2018.  We use the distributed computing resources at the UW-Madison Center for High Throughput Computing to measure the correlations between BTC price and volume of transactions using ledger data from the first 500,000 blocks.  We find evidence for returns chasing in the BTC market, especially during the rapidly increasing price environment of 2017.

## How Does Weather Impact the Spread of COVID-19?

In this paper we use time series data from the the 100 largest cities in the US to study the relationship between weather and the spread of COVID-19.  In agreement with the existing literature, we find a statistically significant inverse relationship between temperature and the rate of spread of COVID-19.  Further, we find that the density of small particulate matter  in the air is directly related to the spread of COVID-19.  This paper expands of the extant literature of the time by considering a full geographic cross section of US cities as well as by using data covering a longer period than had previously been available.
